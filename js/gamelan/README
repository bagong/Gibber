This is a Gamelan extension to Charlie Roberts Audio Live-Coding-environment
Gibber (http://charlie-roberts.com/gibber/info/). It allows to play Javanese
Gamelan-music based on the notation of only a single basic tone-succession
and thereby tries to model some of the competence of Javanese musicians.

In order to get this running you need Google Chrome or Chromium (version 18
upwards are tested).
- You will need all files from Gibber and gamelan.js in place as in the
download from github (branch develop-gam, the default branch).
- Open index.html (in the root-folder of Gibber) in Chrome - you might have to 
reload the page a few times before Gibber loads properly. You will see that it
is ready to play when the red squares at the to left corner start moving.
- Find the menu "load" and click the entry "gamelan"
- On the opening page ignore the settings lines starting with flags. or conf.
Proceed right to prepareEngines() - hit ctrl-Return on that line
- Proceed to gendhing.play() - hit ctrl-Return again and the gamelan should start
playing.

From the settings only the synth-alternative (FM,additive and triangle) and the
logging choices allow changes for now.
You need to reload the page before you can change settings and you need
to make your settings before ctrl-Returning prepareEngines().

gamelanScript is designed to be generic and extensible, so expect more... It is
still in an early stage of development and plays one piece (gendhing) for now.
Most of the develpment-efforts went into the part generation and general
structure/framework, sounds are still very flat and timing is still stiff.
There is no documentation except the code itself and some logging you can see
in the javascript-console.

Contributions are welcome.
