This is the beginning of refactoring gamelan.js to match Gibber's new face.
It doesn't play anything yet, but it might be close ;). Also drums need to
be refactored as FM-Synths. But it's a start.

This is a Gamelan extension to Charlie Roberts Audio Live-Coding-environment
Gibber (http://charlie-roberts.com/gibber/info/). It allows to play Javanese
Gamelan-music from basic notation and thereby tries to model some of the
competence of Javanese musicians. The project name for this extension is
"gamelanScript". It is in a early stage of development and can only play
one piece. There is no documentation except the code itself and some logging
you can see in the javascript-console.

gamelanScript is planned to be generic and extensible, so expect more...
Contributions are welcome.
