  sdLevels : "Subdivision-level account for rhythmical depth in the pulse-based notation. The higher the number, the more rhythmic variablility - but also higher ressource consumption. To describe speed and rhyhtm in Javanese Gamelan-Music we need to distinguish two types of beats - a fully elastic one - which can slow-down and speed up roughly 4 subdivision-levels (sabet). And the less elastic beat, that snaps back (keteg). In a pulse-based notation we need to account for potential subdivision from the beginning, or use offsets and add subdivision levels, when slowdowns occure (tricky, but less expensive).",
  bonangan : "Contextual factors that contribute to pattern-distribution could be represented by tags (semantic), melodic adjacent patterns and monitoring of metric position. Not sure which data structure is best, JSON maybe too hierarchical? Bonangan is so generative in nature, that a more ambitious approach would try to implement algorithms that generate bonangan, rather than pick static (but randomly alternating) data from a dictionary, as is done here for a quick start. Another challenge is to write patterns with most adequate genericity: some patterns, for example the basic mipil-pattern, can be applied to almost any balungan (without looking at pathet or metrics), while others require very specific contexts. Controling pattern selection by contextual factors still requires significant adjustments in the garap module. There evaluation of context is currently very limited."
